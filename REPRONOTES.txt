0h15m: Found how to install octave on Ubuntu, added into Dockerfile
0h16m: Created the script that runs the two octave scripts
0h18m: Modified the script to check against the committed results as part of its process
0h44m: Added script that more smartly checks results (within 10% range), for sake of builds happening in other distributions/versions of octave, like on Travis

Default Travis build (not specifying distribution) results in slightly different numbers in last digits; also puts in different whitespacing
- Expected vs Actual
- R = 0.00837733 vs R = 0.00837735
- d = 0.41411889 vs d = 0.41411902
- ans = 0.22222 vs ans =    0.22222
